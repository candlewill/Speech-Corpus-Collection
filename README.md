# Speech-Corpus-Collection

This repo is a collection of Speech Corpus for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS). 

### ASR Corpus

1. [VCTK](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html)
<br>Around 10.4GB. [Alternative Host](http://www.udialogue.org/download/cstr-vctk-corpus.html)

2. [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/)
<br>Large-scale (1000 hours) corpus of read English speech.

3. [TEDLIUM release 2](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/en/content/ted-lium-corpus)
<br>The TED-LIUM corpus was made from audio talks and their transcriptions available on the TED website. The authors have prepared and filtered these data in order to train acoustic models to participate to the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 2011 (the LIUM English/French SLT system reached the first rank in the SLT task). 

### TTS Corpus

1. [CMU ARCTIC Databases](http://festvox.org/cmu_arctic/)
<br>The databases consist of around 1150 utterances, including US English male (bdl) and female (slt) speakers, as well as other accented speakers.

2. [The World English Bible](http://www.audiotreasure.com/webindex.htm)
<br>The World English Bible is a public domain update of the American Standard Version of 1901 into modern English. Its text and audio recordings are freely avaiable [here](http://www.audiotreasure.com/webindex.htm). Unfortunately, however, each of the audio files matches a chapter, not a verse, so is too long in most cases. [Kyubyong](https://github.com/Kyubyong/tacotron) sliced them by verse manually. You can get them on his [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42868014/WEB.zip).

### General

1. [The NSynth Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth)
<br>NSynth is an audio dataset containing 305,979 musical notes, each with a unique pitch, timbre, and envelope. For 1,006 instruments from commercial sample libraries, we generated four second, monophonic 16kHz audio snippets, referred to as notes, by ranging over every pitch of a standard MIDI pian o (21-108) as well as five different velocities (25, 50, 75, 100, 127). The note was held for the first three seconds and allowed to decay for the final second.
